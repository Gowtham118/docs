# Garden API

Welcome to the Garden Protocol API documentation. This guide will walk you through the integration flow and provide details on the available API endpoints.

The Garden API is designed to facilitate seamless interaction with our bridge, supporting atomic swaps between Bitcoin and EVM or non-EVM chains.

## Integration flow summary

Here’s a high-level overview of the integration flow:

1. **Authenticate**
    - Use the `/nonce` and `/auth` endpoints to establish a secure session for the user.
2. **Request quote**
    - Call `/quote` to retrieve price details for a specific trading pair.
    - Obtain an attested quote using `/attested-quote` to prepare for order creation.
3. **Create order**
    - Submit the attested quote to `/create-order` to execute the swap on-chain.
    - Retrieve an `orderId` for tracking the transaction.
4. **Track order**
    - Use `/get-order` with the `orderId` to monitor the status and progress of the transaction.

Each step is covered in respective sessions.

# User actions

Swapping assets across chains typically requires user interaction at two key stages:  

1. The user must sign the transaction and approve the swap on the source chain.  
2. The user needs to redeem the assets on the destination chain.  

To simplify this process and reduce the complexity for developers, we provide a **Relayer Service**.  

### Relayer service  
The Relayer Service abstracts user actions, automating the initiation and redemption steps. This eliminates the need for manual intervention, making the swap process seamless for end users.  

#### How to use the relayer service  

- **Initiate the swap**  
  Call the `/initiate` endpoint to start the swap on the source chain.  

- **Redeem the swap**  
  Use the `/redeem` endpoint to finalize the swap on the destination chain.  

With these endpoints, you can offload the complexities of user interactions to the Relayer Service, ensuring a smoother developer and user experience.
