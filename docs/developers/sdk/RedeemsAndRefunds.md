# Redeems and Refunds  

Handling redeems and refunds is a critical aspect of ensuring your atomic swaps operate securely and efficiently. These processes manage the completion or recovery of funds on the destination chain based on the state of the swap.  

## Redeems  

Redeeming a swap finalizes the transaction on the destination chain, allowing the user to claim their funds.  

### How It Works  

- **HTLC Completion**: The secret generated during the initiation phase is used to unlock the HTLC and complete the transaction.  
- **Funds Transfer**: The redeemed funds are sent to the specified wallet on the destination chain.  

### Implementation  

Here's how to handle a redeem operation:  

```tsx
import { useGarden } from '@gardenfi/react-hooks';

const { redeem } = useGarden();

const redeemResult = await redeem({
  orderId: "your-order-id",
  btcAddress: "destination-bitcoin-address",
});

if (redeemResult.error) {
  throw new Error(redeemResult.error);
}

console.log("Redeem successful:", redeemResult);
```

## Refunds  

Refunds allow users to recover their funds if a swap fails or the time lock expires.  

### How It Works  

- **HTLC Expiry**: Refunds become available after the time lock in the HTLC expires without a successful redeem.  
- **Funds Recovery**: The original funds are returned to the user on the source chain.  

### Implementation  

Here's how to handle a refund operation:  

```tsx
import { useGarden } from '@gardenfi/react-hooks';

const { refund } = useGarden();

const refundResult = await refund({
  orderId: "your-order-id",
});

if (refundResult.error) {
  throw new Error(refundResult.error);
}

console.log("Refund successful:", refundResult);
```

## Best Practices  

- **Monitor Time Locks**: Ensure your application monitors the status of swaps and time locks to manage redeems and refunds efficiently.  
- **Notify Users**: Notify users about the status of their swaps and prompt them to take action when required.  
- **React Hooks Advantage**: If you're using our **React hooks**, redeem and refund functionalities are abstracted for you, making the process easier.
