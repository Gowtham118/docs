# Overview

Garden was built with the purpose of enabling Bitcoin in DeFi as seamlessly as possible. To achieve this, we’ve designed Garden to be easy to integrate into any wallet, aggregator, or dApp, empowering developers to unlock Bitcoin’s potential in their products.

## What does Garden unlock?

Traditionally, cross-chain flows require users to manually bridge their Bitcoin before using those funds in dApps. Garden simplifies this with an [SDK](./sdk/Sdk.md) and [API](./api/GardenAPI.md) that abstracts the bridging process, letting users directly utilize Bitcoin within DeFi ecosystems.

### Here’s the proposition

- With Garden’s super-fast bridging, users get a native asset experience for Bitcoin on any chain.
- Bitcoin has the potential to become a powerful driver for your distribution as it unlocks a lot of liquidity. By integrating Garden, you provide users with direct access to Bitcoin.
- Garden enables innovative Bitcoin-based applications on EVM-compatible chains without worrying about bridging complexities.

## Choosing between API and SDK

Choosing between Garden’s [SDK](./sdk/Sdk.md) and [API](./api/GardenAPI.md) depends on your project’s requirements and technical expertise:

### SDK

Garden SDK is a customizable API wrapper tailored for React and Node-based dApps. It simplifies integration with a plug-and-play approach, requiring minimal setup. This is ideal for developers seeking a quick and efficient way to integrate Bitcoin swaps with minimal setup. Check out the quick start [guides](./sdk/Sdk.md) for [React](./sdk/react/index.md) and [Node](./sdk/nodejs/index.md) to get an understanding.

### API

Garden APIs are designed for broader application environments, such as wallets, mobile apps, or implementations in Rust, Go, or other programming languages. While highly flexible, it requires more development effort, making it perfect for advanced workflows. Begin with exploring the [API](./api/GardenAPI.md).

| **Feature**            | **SDK**                     | **API**                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Integration speed**   | Quick and simple            | Requires more effort and expertise   |
| **Best for**            | React, Node-based dApps     | Wallets, mobile apps, diverse setups |
| **Customization Level** | High                        | High                                 |
| **Recommended Use Cases** | Standard swaps in existing products | Advanced workflows and unique environments |

## How to get started

Before diving into full-fledged development, familiarize yourself with the [fundamentals](../home/fundamentals/introduction/Introduction.md) and the [intent flow](../home/fundamentals/how-it-works/IntentFlow.md) as you explore the quick start guides shared above.
