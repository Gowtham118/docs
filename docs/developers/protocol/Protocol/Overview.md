[Garden Finance](https://garden.finance) offers a decentralized and permission-less protocol, enabling users to seamlessly bridge Bitcoin (BTC) to its Wrapped counterpart (WBTC) on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains, and vice-versa.

## Key Features

### Atomic Swaps

The protocol facilitates an atomic swap, ensuring a secure and trustless exchange between BTC and WBTC. Atomic swaps eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing counter-party risk and ensuring a seamless exchange process. We use Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs) to enable atomic swaps.

### SEED Token

At the heart of the protocol lies the SEED token, native token of Garden Finance. It serves multiple crucial functions:

**Transaction Fees**: SEED tokens are used to pay fees for the atomic swap process.

**Staking**: SEED holders can participate in the protocol's governance by staking their tokens. Stakers not only influence the protocol's future but also earn rewards from a share of the protocol's generated fees.

### Staking and Governance

SEED holders can stake their tokens to participate in the protocol's governance. Stakers can vote for COBi, it helps to fulfill user's Atomic Swap requests. On voting, certain part of the COBi earned fees will be distributed to the stakers as rewards.

### Payment Channels
