# EVM

We at Garden Finance, current support Ethereum and Arbitrum chains. We are working on adding support for more chains in the future.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. These apps run on a custom-built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.

Features of Ethereum:

- Atomic Swaps

## Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup that scales Ethereum by processing transactions off-chain and posting transaction data on-chain. This reduces the cost of transactions and increases the throughput of the network.

Features of Arbitrum:

- Atomic Swaps
- Staking and Governance
- Payement Channels
