# Roadmap

## North Star

Garden strives to be the best option to exchange Bitcoin with any asset in terms of speed, experience, and liquidity depth. Our goal is to create a Bitcoin trading experience that rivals Centralised Exchanges.

## Focus Areas

- **Bitcoin**: Bitcoin is the biggest volume based on both marketcap and daily trading volume, but still one of the least represented asset in DeFi. We intend to change this, and allow every dApp to support native BTC like it's on their chain.
- **Experience**: We believe in building intuitive products for users, be it a trader or builder. They are at the center of every decision we make as a product. Garden aims to a benchmark for great design and experience in web3.
- **Liquidity**: Garden integrates existing decentralized and centralized liquidity sources, focusing on areas needing improvement to become the most liquid crypto exchange.
- **Chains & Assets**: Support a diverse and strategic set of assets and chains across DeFi.

### Where are we?

We are currently at 20% of our vision. Our objectives for the near future include:

- Developer SDK
- Extending support to more assets and chains
- Reducing swap times from minutes to seconds
- Instant cancellations and refunds
- UI/UX refresh
