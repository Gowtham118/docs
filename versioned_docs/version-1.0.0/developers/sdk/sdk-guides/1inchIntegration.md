# 1inch Integration

Integrating an aggregator like 1inch with the `Garden SDK` allows seamless token swaps between any token and BTC.

To swap from any token to BTC, you first swap the token to WBTC using 1inch, then use the `Garden SDK` to swap from WBTC to BTC.

Conversely, to swap from BTC to any token, you first use the `Garden SDK` to swap BTC to WBTC, and then use 1inch to swap WBTC for the desired token.

## Integration

Coming soon!
